📁 File Name: HOUSE PRICE PREDICTION.
 🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project uses a machine learning model to predict house prices based on features like the number of rooms, area, location, and more. It demonstrates how regression algorithms can be used for real-world applications in the real estate sector.

 📌 Problem Statement

Accurately predicting house prices helps buyers, sellers, and agents make informed decisions. The goal of this project is to build a reliable machine learning model that predicts housing prices using historical data.

 🚀 Proposed Solution

The project includes the following steps:

* Data Collection: Housing data from a CSV file or dataset.
* Data Preprocessing: Cleaning data, handling null values, and converting categorical data.
* Model Building: Using Linear Regression to train on the dataset.
* Evaluation: Measuring performance using metrics like R² Score and Mean Absolute Error.
* Visualization: Comparing predicted vs. actual prices using a scatter plot.

 🧠 Technologies Used

* Python
* Jupyter Notebook
* Scikit-learn
* Pandas
* Matplotlib / Seaborn

📈 Results

The model was trained and tested on real data. It showed strong performance in predicting prices, as seen in the scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted values.

## 🔮 Future Scope

* Use of advanced models like Random Forest or XGBoost
* Incorporation of real-time data and APIs
* Web/mobile app deployment for public use
* Inclusion of location-based and demographic features
